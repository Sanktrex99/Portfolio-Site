    "bio": "Hi! I am Sanket! I've been learning to code for over 3 years now. As a Front End Developer I've worked on to build small scale SPAs (Single Page Applications). Along the journey I realised my passion existed in building new cool builds and work with others to overcome challenges to make it as a usable product (P.S. I have not made any such usable products until now). With this passion, I have now built around 6-7 SPAs like an interactive Shopping list using React and many more. I have mostly learnt to build these through live coaching sessions on Youtube and I have accumulated several reviews about my projects. I develop REAL VALUE, REAL WORLD projects to help enhance my skills of web development. You just need to be open to get hands-on experience and learn the skills that are required to succeed in the real-world.",
